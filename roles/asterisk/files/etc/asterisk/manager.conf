;
; AMI - The Asterisk Manager Interface
;
; Third party application call management support and PBX event supervision
;
; Use the "manager show commands" at the CLI to list available manager commands
; and their authorization levels.
;
; "manager show command <command>" will show a help text.
;
; ---------------------------- SECURITY NOTE -------------------------------
; Note that you should not enable the AMI on a public IP address. If needed,
; block this TCP port with iptables (or another FW software) and reach it
; with IPsec, SSH, or SSL vpn tunnel.  You can also make the manager
; interface available over http/https if Asterisk's http server is enabled in
; http.conf and if both "enabled" and "webenabled" are set to yes in
; this file.  Both default to no.  httptimeout provides the maximum
; timeout in seconds before a web based session is discarded.  The
; default is 60 seconds.
;

enabled = yes
webenabled = no

port = 5038
bindaddr = 0.0.0.0

; authtimeout specifies the maximum number of seconds a client has to
; authenticate.  If the client does not authenticate beofre this timeout
; expires, the client will be disconnected. (default: 30 seconds)

authtimeout = 930

;setvar=PBXACCOUNT=edvina

; user.

;eventfilter=Event: Newchannel
;eventfilter=!Channel: DAHDI.*
; The eventfilter option is used to whitelist or blacklist events per user.
; A filter consists of a (basic/old-style and unanchored) regular expression
; that is run on the entire event data. If the first character of the filter
; is an exclamation mark (!), the filter is appended to the blacklist instead
; of the whitelist. After first checking the read access below, the regular
; expression filters are processed as follows:
; - If no filters are configured all events are reported as normal.
; - If there are white filters only: implied black all filter processed first,
; then white filters.
; - If there are black filters only: implied white all filter processed first,
; then black filters.
; - If there are both white and black filters: implied black all filter processed
; first, then white filters, and lastly black filters.

;
; If the device connected via this user accepts input slowly,
; the timeout for writes to it can be increased to keep it
; from being disconnected (value is in milliseconds)
;
; writetimeout = 100

;
; Authorization for various classes
;
; Read authorization permits you to receive asynchronous events, in general.
; Write authorization permits you to send commands and get back responses.  The
; following classes exist:
;
; all       - All event classes below (including any we may have missed).
; system    - General information about the system and ability to run system
;             management commands, such as Shutdown, Restart, and Reload.
; call      - Information about channels and ability to set information in a
;             running channel.
; log       - Logging information.  Read-only. (Defined but not yet used.)
; verbose   - Verbose information.  Read-only. (Defined but not yet used.)
; agent     - Information about queues and agents and ability to add queue
;             members to a queue.
; user      - Permission to send and receive UserEvent.
; config    - Ability to read and write configuration files.
; command   - Permission to run CLI commands.  Write-only.
; dtmf      - Receive DTMF events.  Read-only.
; reporting - Ability to get information about the system.
; cdr       - Output of cdr_manager, if loaded.  Read-only.
; dialplan  - Receive NewExten and VarSet events.  Read-only.
; originate - Permission to originate new calls.  Write-only.
; agi       - Output AGI commands executed.  Input AGI command to execute.
; cc        - Call Completion events.  Read-only.
; aoc       - Permission to send Advice Of Charge messages and receive Advice
;           - Of Charge events.
; test      - Ability to read TestEvent notifications sent to the Asterisk Test
;             Suite.  Note that this is only enabled when the TEST_FRAMEWORK
;             compiler flag is defined.
; message   - Permissions to send out of call messages. Write-only
